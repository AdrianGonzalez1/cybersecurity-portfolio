# Password Strength Checker

A simple Python script that evaluates the strength of a password based on length, character variety, and complexity.

## How It Works
The program checks for:
- Minimum length of 8 characters
- Upper and lowercase letters
- Numeric digits
- Special characters

It then gives a strength rating: **Weak**, **Moderate**, or **Strong**, and can be used as part of a security toolkit to promote good password hygiene.

## Usage
Run the script with Python:

```bash
python password_strength_checker.py
