# User Access Control System

This project simulates a basic user access control system using Python. It focuses on simple authentication and role-based access logic to help understand how permissions and user roles work in a secure environment.

## Features

- User login with username and password
- Role-based access (e.g., admin, user, guest)
- Simple permission checks based on role
- Command-line interface

## How It Works

1. User is prompted to log in with a username and password
2. The system checks credentials against a stored list
3. If authenticated, the user is granted access based on their role
4. Each role has access to different features or commands

## Example Roles

- **Admin**: Full access to system controls
- **User**: Limited access to certain features
- **Guest**: Read-only access

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Basic file I/O and dictionaries
- Command-line input/output

## How to Run

```bash
python user_access.py
Make sure you are in the user_access_control_system/ folder when running the script.

Notes
This project is for educational purposes and simulates the logic of access control. It does not include secure password storage or hashing.

Let me know if your version includes additional features like user registration or logging, and I can tweak the README to match!
